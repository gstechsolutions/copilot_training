## Repository Setup using a ZIP file

If you receive a ZIP file with training materials, please follow the steps below to configure your training repository setup.

1. Open File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac) and create a new directory named `copilot_workshop` to house your project.

2. Move the ZIP file with the training materials into the newly created `copilot_workshop` directory.

3. If you're on Windows, right-click on the ZIP file, select *Extract All*, and **set the destination to your** `copilot_workshop` directory.
If you're on a Mac, double-click the ZIP file to extract the files into the `copilot_workshop` directory.

4. If the extracted directory is named `copilot_training-main`, rename it to `copilot_training`.

5. Verify your project directory structure looks like this:
```ssh
copilot_workshop
    |_copilot_training
        |_c101
        |_c201
        |_rest_files_and_folders
```
Adjust your directory structure if it differs from the one shown above.

6. If your directory structure looks correct, continue setting up your local development environment by following the instructions in either the [windows_setup.md](./windows_setup.md) or the [mac_setup.md](./mac_setup.md) file, depending on your operating system.
