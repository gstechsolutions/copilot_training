# Template Repository - Copilot training template repository 

This repository contains training material workshops on GitHub Copilot.

This workshop is held at venue `X` on `DATE` at `TIME`.

## Workshop Outline

*Copilot training workshop* provides participants with a 101 and 201 introduction to integrating Github Copilot into the software development process.

Attendees will learn about setting up a local development environment which integrates the Copilot plugin. Students will then progress into learning how to use Copilot in a variety of fashions to write code and unit tests.

The workshop is broken out into two separate sessions, 101 and 201. Each session is approximately 4 hours in length. 

## Prerequisites and Setup
The setup steps for account prerequisites, IDE & Copilot installation, and local account permissions must be satisfied/completed prior to the workshop.

You can find the prerequisites and detailed environment setup information in the [SETUP.md](./setup/SETUP.md) file.

## Disclaimer

GitHub Copilot is an AI tool that is powered by generative AI models and as such its responses are probabilistic not deterministic. This means you might get slightly different responses to the questions we go through in this training.
